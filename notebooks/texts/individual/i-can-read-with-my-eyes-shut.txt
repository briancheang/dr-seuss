I can read in red.
I can read in blue.
I can read in pickle-color too.

I can read in bed.
And in purple.
And in brown.
I can read in a circle and upside-down!

I can read with my left eye.
I can read with my right.
I can read Mississippi with my eyes shut tight!

Mississippi,
Indianapolis,
and
Hallelujah,
too!
I can read them
with my eyes shut!
That is
VERY HARD
to do!

But it's bad
for my hat
and makes
my eyebrows
get red hot.
SO...
reading with
my eyes shut
I don't do an awful lot.

And when I keep them open
I can read with much more speed.
You have to be a speedy reader
'cause there's so, so much to read!

You can read about trees...
and bees...
and knees.
And knees on trees!
And bees on threes!

You can read about anchors.
And all about ants.
You can read
about ankles!
And crocodile pants!

You can read about hoses...
and how to smell roses...
and what
you should do
about owls on noses!

Young cat! If you keep
your eyes open enough,
oh, the stuff you will learn!
The most wonderful stuff!
You'll learn about...
fishbones...
and wishbones.
You'll learn
about trombones,
too.
You'll learn
about Jake
the Pillow Snake
and all about
Foo-Foo the Snoo.

You can learn about ice.
You can learn about mice.
Mice on ice.
And ice on mice.
You can learn about
the price of ice.
Nice ice
for sale.
Ten cents a pail.

You can learn about SAD...
and GLAD...
and MAD!
There are 
so many things
you can learn about.
BUT...
you'll miss
the best things
if you keep
your eyes shut.

The more that you read,
the more things you will know.
The more that you learn,
the more places you'll go.

You might learn
a way to earn
a few dollars.
Or how to make doughnuts...
or kangaroo collars.

You can learn to read music
and play a Hut-Zut
if you keep your eyes open.
But not with them shut.

If you read with your eyes shut
you're likely to find
that the place where you're going
is far, far behind

SO...
that's why I tell you
to keep your eyes wide.
Keep them wide open...
at least on one side.
