       "'the sun did not shine. it was too wet to play. so we sat in the house all that cold, cold, wet day.  i sat there with sally. we sat there, we two. and i said, \"how i wish we had something to do!\"  too wet to go out and too cold to play ball. so we sat in the house. we did nothing at all.  so all we could do was to  sit! sit! sit! sit!  and we did not like it. not one little bit.  bump!  and then something went bump! how that bump made us jump!  we looked! then we saw him step in on the mat! we looked! and we saw him! the cat in the hat! and he said to us, \"why do you sit there like that?\" \"i know it is wet and the sun is not sunny. but we can have lots of good fun that is funny!\"  \"i know some good games we could play,\" said the cat. \"i know some new tricks,\" said the cat in the hat. \"a lot of good tricks. i will show them to you. your mother will not mind at all if i do.\"  then sally and i did not know what to say. our mother was out of the house for the day.  but our fish said, \"no! no! make that cat go away! tell that cat in the hat you do not want to play. he should not be here. he should not be about. he should not be here when your mother is out!\"  \"now! now! have no fear. have no fear!\" said the cat. \"my tricks are not bad,\" said the cat in the hat. \"why, we can have lots of good fun, if you wish, with a game that i call up-up-up with a fish!\"  \"put me down!\" said the fish. \"this is no fun at all! put me down!\" said the fish. \"i do not wish to fall!\"  \"have no fear!\" said the cat. \"i will not let you fall. i will hold you up high as i stand on a ball. with a book on one hand! and a cup on my hat! but that is not all i can do!\" said the cat...  \"look at me! look at me now!\" said the cat. \"with a cup and a cake on the top of my hat! i can hold up two books! i can hold up the fish! and a litte toy ship! and some milk on a dish! and look! i can hop up and down on the ball! but that is not all! oh, no. that is not all...  \"look at me! look at me! look at me now! it is fun to have fun but you have to know how. i can hold up the cup and the milk and the cake! i can hold up these books! and the fish on a rake! i can hold the toy ship and a little toy man! and look! with my tail i can hold a red fan! i can fan with the fan as i hop on the ball! but that is not all. oh, no. that is not all....\"  that is what the cat said... then he fell on his head! he came down with a bump from up there on the ball. and sally and i, we saw all the things fall!  and our fish came down, too. he fell into a pot! he said, \"do i like this?\" oh, no! i do not. this is not a good game,\" said our fish as he lit. \"no, i do not like it, not one little bit!\"  \"now look what you did!\" said the fish to the cat. \"now look at this house! look at this! look at that! you sank our toy ship, sank it deep in the cake. you shook up our house and you bent our new rake. you should not be here when our mother is not. you get out of this house!\" said the fish in the pot.  \"but i like to be here. oh, i like it a lot!\" said the cat in the hat to the fish in the pot. \"i will not go away. i do not wish to go! and so,\" said the cat in the hat,  \"so so so...  i will show you another good game that i know!\" and then he ran out. and, then, fast as a fox, the cat in the hat came back in with a box. a big red wood box. it was shut with a hook. \"now look at this trick,\" said the cat. \"take a look!\"  then he got up on top with a tip of his hat. \"i call this game fun-in-a-box,\" said the cat. \"in this box are two things i will show to you now. you will like these two things,\" said the cat with a bow.  \"i will pick up the hook. you will see something new. two things. and i call them thing one and thing two. these things will not bite you. they want to have fun.\" then, out of the box came thing two and thing one! and they ran to us fast. they said, \"how do you do? would you like to shake hands with thing one and thing two?\"  and sally and i did not know what to do. so we had to shake hands with thing one and thing two. we shook their two hands. but our fish said, \"no! no! those things should not be in this house! make them go! \"they should not be here when your mother is not! put them out! put them out!\" said the fish in the pot.  \"have no fear, little fish,\" said the cat in the hat. \"these things are good things.\" and he gave them a pat. \"they are tame. oh, so tame! they have come here to play. they will give you some fun on this wet, wet, wet day.\"  \"now, here is a game that they like,\" said the cat. \"they like to fly kites,\" said the cat in the hat  \"no! not in the house!\" said the fish in the pot. \"they should not fly kites in a house! they should not. oh, the things they will bump! oh, the things they will hit! oh, i do not like it! not one little bit!\" then sally and i saw them run down the hall. we saw those two things bump their kites on the wall! bump! thump! thump! bump! down the wall in the hall.  thing two and thing one! they ran up! they ran down! on the string of one kite we saw mother\\'s new gown! her gown with the dots that are pink, white and red. then we saw one kite bump on the head of her bed!  then those things ran about with big bumps, jumps and kicks and with hops and big thumps and all kinds of bad tricks. and i said, \"i do not like the way that they play if mother could see this, oh, what would she say!\"  then our fish said, \"look! look!\" and our fish shook with fear. \"your mother is on her way home! do you hear? oh, what will she do to us? what will she say? oh, she will not like it to find us this way!\"  \"so, do something! fast!\" said the fish. \"do you hear! i saw her. your mother! your mother is near! so, as fast as you can, think of something to do! you will have to get rid of thing one and thing two!\"  so, as fast as i could, i went after my net. and i said, \"with my net i can get them i bet. i bet, with my net, i can get those things yet!\"  then i let down my net. it came down with a plop! and i had them! at last! thoe two things had to stop. then i said to the cat, \"now you do as i say. you pack up those things and you take them away!\"  \"oh dear!\" said the cat, \"you did not like our game... oh dear.  what a shame! what a shame! what a shame!\"  then he shut up the things in the box with the hook. and the cat went away with a sad kind of look.  \"that is good,\" said the fish. \"he has gone away. yes. but your mother will come. she will find this big mess! and this mess is so big and so deep and so tall, we ca not pick it up. there is no way at all!\"  and then! who was back in the house? why, the cat! \"have no fear of this mess,\" said the cat in the hat. \"i always pick up all my playthings and so... i will show you another good trick that i know!\"  then we saw him pick up all the things that were down. he picked up the cake, and the rake, and the gown, and the milk, and the strings, and the books, and the dish, and the fan, and the cup, and the ship, and the fish. and he put them away. then he said, \"that is that.\" and then he was gone with a tip of his hat.  then our mother came in and she said to us two, \"did you have any fun? tell me. what did you do?\"  and sally and i did not know what to say. should we tell her the things that went on there that day?  should we tell her about it? now, what should we do? well... what would you do if your mother asked you?on the th of may, in the jungle of nool, in the heat of the day, in the cool of the pool, he was splashing... enjoying the jungle\\'s great joys... when horton the elephant heard a small noise. so horton stopped splashing. he looked toward the sound. \"that\\'s funny,\" thought horton. \"there\\'s no one around.\" then he heard it again! just a very faint yelp as if some tiny person were calling for help. \"i\\'ll help you,\" said horton. \"but who are you? where?\" he looked and he looked. he could see nothing there but a small speck of dust blowing past through the air. \"i say!\" murmured horton. \"i\\'ve never heard tell of a small speck of dust that is able to yell. so you know what i think?... why, i think that there must be someone on top of that small speck of dust! some sort of a creature of very small size, too small to be seen by an elephant\\'s eyes... \"... some poor little person who\\'s shaking with fear that he\\'ll blow in the pool! he has no way to steer! i\\'ll just have to save him. because, after all, a person\\'s a person, no matter how small.\" so, gently, and using the greatest of care, the elephant stretched his great trunk through the air, and he lifted the dust speck and carried it over and placed it down, safe, on a very soft clover. \"humpf!\" humpfted a voice. twas a sour kangaroo. and the you kangaroo in her pouch said \"humpf\" too. \" why, that speck is as small as the head of a pin. a person on that?... why, there never has been!\" \"believe me,\" said horton. \"i tell you sincerely, my ears are quite keen and i heard him quite clearly. i know there\\'s a person down there. and, what\\'s more, quite likely there\\'s two. even three. even four. quite likely... \"...a family, for all that we know! a family with children just starting to grow. so, please,\" horton said, \"as a favor to me, try not to disturb them. just please let them be.\" \"i think you\\'re a fool!\" laughed the sour kangaroo and the young kangaroo in her pouch said, \"me, too! you\\'re the biggest blame fool in the jungle of nool!\" and the kangaroos plunged in the cool of the pool. \"what terrible splashing!\" the elephant frowned. \"i can\\'t let my very small person get drowned!\" i\\'ve got to protect them. i\\'m bigger than they.\" so he plucked up the clover and hustled away. through the high jungle tree tops, the news quickly spread \"he talks to a dust speck! he\\'s out of his head! just look at him walk with that speck on that flower!\" and horton walked, worrying, almost an hour. \"should i put this speck down?...\" horton thought with alarm. \"if  i do, these small persons may come to great harm. i can\\'t put it down. and i won\\'t! after all a person\\'s a person. no matter how small.\" then horton stopped walking. the speck-voice was talking! the voice was so faint he could just barley hear it. \"speak up, please\" said horton. he put his ear near it. \"my friend,\" came the voice, \"you\\'re a very fine friend. you\\'ve helped all us folks on this dust speck no end. you\\'ve saved all our houses, our ceilings and floors. you\\'ve saved all our churches and grocery stores.\" \"you mean...\" horton gasped, \"you have buildings there, too?\" \"oh, yes,\" piped the voice. \"we most certainly do... \"i know,\" called the voice, \"i\\'m too small to be seen but i\\'m mayor of a town that is friendly and clean. our buildings, to you, would seem terribly small but to us, who aren\\'t big, they are wonderfully tall. my town is called who-ville, for i am a who and we whos are all thankful and grateful to you.\" and horton called back to the mayor of the town, \"you\\'re safe now. don\\'t worry. i won\\'t let you down.\" but, just as he spoke to the mayor of the speck, three big jungle monkeys climbed up horton\\'s neck! the wickersham brothers came shouting, \"what rot! this elephant\\'s talking to whos who are not! there aren\\'t any whos! and they don\\'t have a mayor! and we\\'re going to stop all the nonsense! so there!\" they snatched horton\\'s clover! they carried it off to a black-bottomed eagle named vlad vlad-i-koff, a mighty strong eagle, of very swift wing, and they said, \"will you kindly get rid of this thing?\" and, before the poor elephant even could speak, that eagle flew off with the flower in his beak. all that latte afternoon and far into the night that black-bottomed bird flapped his wings in fast flight, while horton chased after, with groans, over stones that tattered his toenails and battered his bones, and begged, \"please don\\'t harm all my little folks, who have as much right to live as us bigger folks do!\" but far, far beyond him, that eagle kept flapping and over his shoulder called back, \"quit your yapping. i\\'ll fly the night through. i\\'m a bird. i don\\'t mind it. and i\\'ll hide this, tomorrow, where you\\'ll never find it!\" and at  the next morning he did it. it sure was a terrible place that he hid it. he let that small clover drop somewhere inside of a great patch of clovers a hundred miles wide! \"find that!\" sneered the bird. \"but i think you will fail.\" and he left with a flip of his blackbottomed tail. \"i\\'ll find it!\" cried horton. \"i\\'ll find it or bust! i shall find my friends on my small speck of dust!\" and clover, by clover, by clover with care he picked up and searched them, and called, \"are you there?\" but clover, by clover, by clover he found that the one that he sough for was just not around. and by noon poor old horton, more dead than alive, had picked, searched, and piled up, nine thousand and five.  then, on through the afternoon, hour after hour... till he found them at last! on the three millionth flower! \"my friends!\" cried the elephant. \"tell me! do tell! are you safe? are you sound? are you whole? are you well?\" from down on the speck came the voice of the mayor \"we\\'ve really had trouble! much more that our share. when that black-bottomed birdie let go and we dropped, we landed so hard that our clocks have all stopped. our tea-pots are broken. our rocking-chairs smashed. and our bicycle tired all blew up when we crashed. so, horton, please!\" pleaded that voice of the mayor\\'s, \"will you stick by us whos while we\\'re making repairs?\" \"of course,\" horton answered. \"of course i will stick. i\\'ll stick by you small folks through thin and through thick!\" \"humpf!\" humpfed a voice! \"for almost two days you\\'ve run wild and insisted on chatting with persons who\\'ve never existed. such carryings-on in our peaceable jungle! we\\'ve had quite enough of your bellowing bungle! and i\\'m here to state,\" snapped the big kangaroo, \"that your silly nonsensical game is all through!\" and the young kangaroo in her pouch said, \"me, too!\" \"with the help of the wickersham brothers and dozens of wickersham uncles and wickersham cousins and wickersham in-laws, whose help i\\'ve engaged, you\\'re going to be roped! and you\\'re going to be caged! and, as for our dust speck...hah! that we shall boil in hot steaming kettle of beezle-nut oil!\" \"boil it?...\" gasped horton! \"oh, that you can\\'t do! it\\'s all full of persons! they\\'ll prove it to you!\" \"mr. mayor! mr. mayor!\" horton called. \"mr. mayor! you\\'ve got to prove now that you really are there! so call a big meeting. get everyone out. make every who holler! make every who shout! make every who scream! if you don\\'t, every who is going to end up in a beezle-nut stew!\" and, down on the dust speck, the scared little mayor quick called a big meeting in who-ville town square. and his people cried loudly. they cried out in fear \"we are here! we are here! we are here! we are here!\" the elephant smiled \"that was clear as a bell. you kangaroos surely heard that very well.\" \"all i heard,\" snapped the big kangaroo, \"was the breeze, and the faint sound of wind through the far distant trees. i heard no small voices. and you didn\\'t either.\" and the young kangaroo in her pouch said, \"me, neither.\" \"grab him!\" they shouted. \"and cage the big dope! lasso his stomach with ten miles of rope! tie the knots tight so he\\'ll never shake loose! then dunk that dumb speck in the beezle-nut juice!\" horton fought back with great vigor and vim but the wickersham gang was too many for him. they beat him! they mauled him! they started to haul him into his cage! but he managed to call to the mayor \"don\\'t give up! i believe in you all! a person\\'s a person, no  matter how small! and you very small persons will not have to die if you make yourselves heard! so come on, now, and try!\" the mayor grabbed a tom-tom. he started to smack it. and, all over who-ville, they whooped up a racket. they rattled tin kettles! they beat on brass pans, on garbage pail tops and old cranberry cans! they blew on bazookas and blasted great toots on clarinets, oompahs and boom-pahs and flutes! great gusts of loud racket rang high through the air. they rattled and shook the whole sky! and the mayor called up through the howling mad hullabaloo \"hey, horton! how\\'s this? is our sound coming through?\" and horton called back, \"i can hear you fine. but the kangaroos\\' ears aren\\'t as strong, quite, as mine. they don\\'t hear a thing! are you sure all your boys are doing their best? are they all making noise? are you sure every who down in who-ville is working? quick! look through your town! is there anyone shirking?\" through the town rushed the mayor from the east to the west. but everyone seemed to be doing his best. everyone seemed to be yapping or yipping! everyone seemed to be beeping or bipping! but it wasn\\'t enough, all this ruckus and roar! he had to find someone to help him make more. he raced through each building! he searched floor-to-floor! and, just as he felt he as getting nowhere, and almost about to give up in despair, he suddenly burst through a door and that mayor discovered on shirker! quite hidden away in the fairfax apartments apartment -j a very small, very small shirker named jo-jo was standing, and bouncing a yo-yo! not making a sound! not a yipp! not a chirp! and the mayor rushed inside and he greabbed the young twerp! and he climbed with the lad up the eiffelberg tower. \"this,\" cried the mayor, \"is your town\\'s darkest hour! the time for all whos who have blood that is red to come to the aid of their country!\" he said. \"we\\'ve got to make noises in greater amounts! so, open your mouth, lad! for every voice counts!\" thus he spoke as he climbed. when they got to the top, the lad cleared his throat and he shouted out, \"yopp!\" and that yopp... that one small extra yopp put it over! finally, at last! from that speck on that clover their voices were heard! they rang out clear and clean. and the elephant smiled. \"do you see what i mean?... they\\'ve proved they are persons, not matter how small. and their whole world was saved by the smallest of all!\" \"how true! yes, how true,\" said the big kangaroo. \"and, from now on, you know what i\\'m planning to do?... from now on, i\\'m going to protect them with you!\" and the young kangaroo in her pouch said,... \"...me, too! from sun in the summer. from rain when it\\'s fall-ish, i\\'m going to protect them. no matter how small-ish!one apple up on top!  two apples up on top!  look, you. i can do it, too.  look! see! i can do three!

 then i looked up. and i sad \"oh, man!\" and that\\'s how wacky wednesday began.  i looked out the window. and i said, \"gee!\" more things were wacky! and i saw three.  i went down the hall and i said \"hey!\" three more things were wacky today!  in the bathroom, more! in the bathroom, four!  i began to dress. then i said, \"wow!\" four more things were wacky now!  i looked in the kitchen. i said \"by cracky! five more things  are very wacky!\"  i was late for school. i started along. and i saw that  six more things were wrong.  and then seven more!  and the sutherland sisters! they looked wacky, too. they said \"nothing is wacky around here but you!\"  \"but look!\" i yelled. \"eight things are wrong here at school.\" \"nothing is wrong.\" they said \"don\\'t be a fool.\"  i ran into school i yelled to miss bass... ... \"look! nine things are wacky right here in your class!\"  \"nothing is wacky here in my class! get out! you\\'re the wacky one! out!\" said miss bass.  i went out the school door. things were worse than before. i couldn\\'t believe it. ten wacky things more!  then i counted eleven! then... twelve worse things! i got scared and i ran. i ran and knocked over patrolman mcgann.  \"i\\'m sorry, patrolman.\"  that\\'s all i could say. \"don\\'t be sorry,\" he smiled. \"it\\'s that kind of a day. but be glad! wacky wednesday will soon go away!\"  \"only twenty things more will be wacky,\" he said. \"just find them and then you can go back to bed.\"  wacky wednesday was gone when i counted them all. and i even got rid of that shoe on the wall.if we didn\\'t have birthdays, you wouldn\\'t be you. if you\\'d never been born, well then what would you do? if you\\'d never been born, well then what would you be? you might be a fish! or a toad in a tree! you might be a doorknob! or three baked potatoes! you might be a bag full of hard green tomatoes.  or worse than all that...why, you might be a wasn\\'t! a wasn\\'t has no fun at all. no, he doesn\\'t. a wasn\\'t just isn\\'t. he just isn\\'t present. but you...you are you! and, now isn\\'t that pleasant!  today you are you! that is truer than true! there is no one alive... ...who is you-er than you! shout loud, \"i am lucky to be what i am! thank goodness i\\'m not just a clam or a ham or a dusty old jar of sour gooseberry jam! i am what i am! that\\'s a great thing to be! if i say so myself, happy birthday to me!\"it\\'s a pretty good zoo,\" said young gerald mcgrew,  \"and the fellow who runs it  seems proud of it too.  but if i ran the zoo,\" said young gerald mcgrew, \"i\\'d make a few changes. that\\'s just what i\\'d do.  the lions and tigers and that kind of stuff  they have up here now are not quite good enough. you see things like these in any old zoo.  they\\'re awfully oldfashioned. i want something new!  so i\\'d open each cage, i\\'ll unlock every pen, let the animals go and start over again.  and somehow or other i think i could find  some beasts of some beasts of a more unusual kind.  a fourfooted lion\\'s not much of a beast. the one in my zoo will have  feet at least.  five legs on the left and five more on the right.  then people will stare, and they\\'ll say,  \\'what a sight!\\' my new zoo, mcgrew zoo, will make people talk.  my new zoo, mcgrew zoo, will make people gawk.  they\\'ll be so surprised, they\\'ll swallow their gum.  they\\'ll ask when they see my strange animals come, \\'where do you suppose he gets things like that from?\\' if you want to catch beasts you don\\'t see every day, you have to go places quite out of the way. you have to go places no others can get to. you have to get cold and you have to get wet too.  i\\'ll catch \\'em in caves, i\\'ll catch \\'em in brooks,  i\\'ll catch \\'em in crannies, i\\'ll catch \\'em in nooks  that you don\\'t read about in geography books.  i\\'ll load up five boats with a family of joats  whose feet are like cows, but wear squirrelskin coats,  and sit like dogs, but have voices like goats  excepting they can\\'t sing the very high notes.  and then i\\'ll go down to the wilds of nantucket,  and capture a family of lunks in a bucket.  then people will say, \\'now i like that boy heaps.  his new zoo, mcgrew zoo, is growing by leaps.  he captures them wild, he captures them meek,  he captures them slim, he captures them sleek. what do you suppose he will capture next week?\\' in the far western part  in southeast north dakota lives a very fine animal called the iota.  but i\\'ll capture one  who is even much finer  in the northeastern west part of south carolina.  when people see him they will say,  \\'now by thunder! this new zoo, mcgrew zoo, is really a wonder!\\' i\\'ll bag a big bug who is very surprising,  a feller who has a propeller for rising  and zooming around making crosscountry hops,  from texas to boston with only two stops.  now that kind of thing for a bug is just tops!  in a cave in kartoom is a beast called a natch  that no other hunter\\'s been able to catch.  he\\'s hidden for years in his cave with a pout  and no one\\'s been able to make him come out.  but i\\'ll coax him out with a wonderful meal  that\\'s cooked by my cooks in my cooker mobile.  they\\'ll fix up a dish that is just to his taste  three chicken croquettes made of library paste.  then sprinkled with peanut shucks, pickled and spiced,  then baked at  degrees and then iced.  it\\'s mighty hard cooking to cook up such feasts  but that\\'s how the new zoo, mcgrew zoo, gets beasts.  \\'he hunts with such vims, he hunts with such vigor.  his new zoo, mcgrew\\'s zoo, gets bigger and bigger.\\' then the whole town will gasp, why this boy never sleeps!  no keeper before ever kept what he keeps.  there\\'s no telling what that young fellow will do!\\'  and then, just to show them, i\\'ll sail to katroo  and bring back an itkutch a preep and a proo,  a nerkle, a nerd and a seersucker too.  \\'this zookeeper, new keeper\\'s simply astounding. he travels so far that you think he\\'d drop!  when do you suppose this young fellow will stop?\\' stop... ? well, i should.  but i won\\'t stop until i\\'ve captures the fizzamawizzamadill,  the world\\'s biggest bird from the island of gwark  who only eats pine trees and spits out the bark.  and boy! when i get him back home to my park,  the whole world will say,  \\'young mcgrew\\'s made his mark.\\'on the last day of summer, ten hours before fall...  my grandfather took me out to the wall.   for a while he stood silent. then finally he said, with a very sad shake of his very old head, \"as you know, on this side of the wall we are yooks.  on the far other side of this wall live the zooks.\"   then my grandfather said, \"it\\'s high time that you knew of the terribly horrible thing that zooks do.  in every zook house and in every zook town every zook eats his bread with the butter side down!\"   \"but we yooks, as you know, when we breakfast or sup, spread our bread,\"  grandpa said, \"with the butter side up.  that\\'s the right, honest way!\"  grandpa gritted his teeth. \"so you can\\'t trust a zook who spreads bread underneath! every zook must be watched! he has kinks in his soul!  that\\'s why, as a youth, i made watching my goal, watching zooks for the zook-watching border patrol!  in those day, of course, the wall wasn\\'t so high and i could look any zook square in the eye.   if he dared to come close i could give him a twitch with my tough tufted prickely snick-berry switch.  for a while that worked fine.  all the zooks stayed away and our country was safe.  then one terrible day a very rude zook by the name of vanitch snuck up and slingshotted my snick-berry switch!  with my broken- off switch, with my head hung in shame, to the chief lookeroo in great sorrow i came.  but our leader just smiled.  he said, \" you\\'re not to blame.  and those zooks will be sorry they started this game.   \"we\\'ll dress you right up in a fancier suit!  we\\'ll give you a fancier slingshot to shoot!\"  and he ordered the boys in the back room to figger how to build me some sort of triple-sling jigger.   with my triple-sling jigger i sure felt much bigger.   i marched to the wall with great vim and great vigor, right up to vanitch with my hand on the trigger.  \"i\\'ll have no more nonsense,\"  i said with a frown, \"from zooks who eat bread with the butter side down!\"   vanitch looked quite sickly.  he ran off quite quickly.   i\\'m unhappy to say he came back the next day in a spiffy new suit with a big new machine, and he snarled as he said, looking frightfully mean, \"you may fling those hard rocks with your triple-sling jigger.  but i, also, now have my hand on a trigger!   \"my wonderful weapon, the jigger-rock snatchem, will fling em right back just as quick as we catch em.  we\\'ll have no more nonsense.  we\\'ll take no more gupp from you yooks who eat bread with th butter side up!\"  \"i have failed, sir,\"  i sobbed as i made my report to the chief yookeroo in the headquarters fort.  he just laughed. \"you\\'ve done nothing at all of the sort.  our slingshots have failed.  that was old-fashioned stuff.  slingshots, dear boy, are not modern enough.   \"all we need is some newfangled kind of gun.  my boys in the back room have already begun to think up a walloping whiz-zinger one!  my bright boys are thinking.  they\\'re on the right track.  they\\'ll think one up quick and we\\'ll send you right back!\"   they thought up a great one!  they certainly did.  they thought up a gun called the kick-a-doo powder and ant\\'s eggs and bees\\' legs and dried-fried clam chowder.  and they carefully trained a real smart dog named daniel to serve as our country\\'s first gun-toting spaniel.   then daniel, the kick-a-poo spaniel, and i marched back toward the wall with our heads held up gigh while everyone cheered and their cheers filled the sky \"fight! fight for the butter side up! do or die!\"   well...  we didn\\'t do.  and we didn\\'t quite die.  but we sure did get worsted, poor daniel and i.  vanitch was there too! and he said, the old pig, \"the boys as in my back room invented this rig called the eight-nozzled, elephant-toted boom-blitz.  it shoots high-explosive sour cherry stone pits and will put your dumb kick-a-poo kid on the fritz!\"  poor daniel and i were scared out of our witz!   once more, by vanitch i was bested and beat.  once again i limped home from the wall in defeat.  i dragged and i sagged and my spirits were low, as low as i thought that they ever could go, when i heard a boom-bah! and a diddle-dee-dill!  and our butter-up band marched up over the hill!   the chief yookeroo had sent them to meet me along with the right-side-up song girls to greet me.  they sang  \"oh, be faithful! believe in thy butter!\"  and they lifted my spirits right out of the gutter!   \"my boy\", smiled the chief yookeroo, \"we\\'ve just voted and made you a general! you\\'ve been promoted.  your pretty new uniform\\'s ready.  get in it! the big war is coming.  you\\'re going to begin it!  and what\\'s more, this time you are certain to win it.   \"my boys in the back room have finally found how.  just wait till you see what they\\'ve puttered up now!  in their great new machine you\\'ll fly over that wall and clobber those butter-down zooks one and all!\"   those boys in the back room sure knew how to putter! they made me a thing called the utterly sputter and i jumped aboard with my heart all aflutter and steered toward the land of the upside-down butter.   this machine was so modern, so frightfully new, no one knew quite exactly just what it would do!   but it had several faucets that sprinkled blue goo which, somehow, would sprinkle the zooks as i flew and gum up that upside-down butter they chew.   i was racing pell-mell when i heard a voice yell, \"if you sprinkle us zooks, you\\'ll get sprinkled as well!\"   vanitch had a sputter exactly like mine!  and he yelled, \"my blue-gooer is working just fine!  and i\\'m here to say that if yooks can goo zooks, you\\'d better forget it. cause zooks can goo yooks!\"  i flew right back home and, as you may have guessed, i was downright despondent, disturbed, and depressed.  and i saw, just as soon as i stepped back on land, so were all of the girls of the butter-up band.   the chief drum majorette, miz yookie-ann sue, said, \"that was a pretty sour flight that you flew.  and the chief yookeroo has been looking for you!\"  i raced to his office.  the place was a sight.  \"have no fears,\" said the chief.  \"everything is all right.  my bright back room boys have been brighter than bright.  they\\'ve thought up a gadget that\\'s newer than new.  it is filled with mysterious moo-lacka-moo and can blow all those zooks clear to sala-ma-goo.  they\\'ve invented the bitsy big-boy boomeroo!   \"you just run to the wall like a nice little man.  drop this bomb on the zooks just as fast as you can.  i have ordered all yooks to stay safe underground while the bitsy big-boy boomeroo is around.\"   as i raced for that wall, with the bomb in my hand, i noticed that every last yook in our land was obeying our chief yookeroo\\'s grim command.   they were all bravely marching, with banners aflutter, down a hole! for their country!  and right-side-up butter!   that\\'s when grandfather found me!  he grabbed me.  he said, \"you should be down that hole!  and you\\'re up here instead!  but perhaps this is all for the better, somehow.  you will see me make history! right here! and right now!  grandpa leapt up that wall with a lopulous leap and he clearedhis harse throat with a bopulous beep.  he screamed, \"here\\'s the end of that terrible town full of zooks who eat bread with the butter side down!\"   and at the very instant we heard a klupp-klupp of feet on the wall and old vanitch klupped up! the boys in his back room had made him one too!  in his fist was another big-boy boomeroo!  \"i\\'ll blow you,\" he yelled, \"into pork and wee beans! i\\'ll butter-side-up you to small smithereens!\"  \"grandpa!\"  i shouted.  \"be careful! oh, gee! who\\'s going to drop it?  will you...? or will he...?  \"be patient,\" said grandpa. \"we\\'ll see. we will see...\"left foot, left foot right foot, right. feet in the morning. feet at night. left foot, left foot, left foot, right. wet foot, dry foot. high foot, low foot. front feet, back feet. red feet, black feet. left foot, right foot. feet, feet, feet. how many, many feet you meet. slow feet, quick feet. trick feet, sick feet. up feet, down feet. here come clown feet. small feet, big feet. here come pig feet. his feet, her feet. fuzzy fur feet. in the house, and on the street how many, many feet you meet. up in the air feet, over a chair feet. more and more feet twenty-four feet here come more and more.............. ..........and more feet!

the places you\\'ll go!  you\\'ll be on y our way up! you\\'ll be seeing great sights! you\\'ll join the high fliers who soar to high heights.  you won\\'t lag behind, because you\\'ll have the speed. you\\'ll pass the whole gang and you\\'ll soon take the lead. wherever you fly, you\\'ll be best of the best. wherever you go, you will top all the rest.  except when you don\\'t. because, sometimes, you won\\'t.  i\\'m sorry to say so but, sadly, it\\'s true that bang-ups and hang-ups can happen to you.  you can get all hung up in a prickle-ly perch. and your gang will fly on. you\\'ll be left in a lurch.  you\\'ll come down from the lurch with an unpleasant bump. and the chances are, then, that you\\'ll be in a slump.  and when you\\'re in a slump, you\\'re not in for much fun. un-slumping yourself is not easily done.  you will come to a place where the streets are not marked. some windows are lighted. but mostly they\\'re darked. a place you could sprain both your elbow and chin! do you dare to stay out? do you dare to go in? how much can you lose? how much can you win?  and if you go in, should you turn left or right... or right-and-three-quarters? or, maybe, not quite? or go around back and sneak in from behind? simple it\\'s not, i\\'m afraid you will find, for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.  you can get so confused that you\\'ll start in to race down long wiggled roads at a break-necking pace and grind on for miles cross weirdish wild space, headed, i fear, toward a most useless place. the waiting place...  ...for people just waiting. waiting for a train to go or a bus to come, or a plane to go or the mail to come, or the rain to go or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow or the waiting around for a yes or no or waiting for their hair to grow. everyone is just waiting.  waiting for the fish to bite or waiting for the wind to fly a kite or waiting around for friday night or waiting, perhaps, for their uncle jake or a pot to boil, or a better break or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants or a wig with curls, or another chance. everyone is just waiting.  no! that\\'s not for you!  somehow you\\'ll escape all that waiting and staying you\\'ll find the bright places where boom bands are playing.  with banner flip-flapping, once more you\\'ll ride high! ready for anything under the sky. ready because you\\'re that kind of a guy!  oh, the places you\\'ll go! there is fun to be done! there are points to be scored. there are games to be won. and the magical things you can do with that ball will make you the winning-est winner of all. fame! you\\'ll be as famous as famous can be, with the whole wide world watching you win on tv.  except when they don\\'t because, sometimes they won\\'t.  i\\'m afraid that some times you\\'ll play lonely games too. games you can\\'t win \\'cause you\\'ll play against you.  all alone! whether you like it or not, alone will be something you\\'ll be quite a lot.  and when you\\'re alone, there\\'s a very good chance you\\'ll meet things that scare you right out of your pants. there are some, down the road between hither and yon, that can scare you so much you won\\'t want to go on.  but on you will go though the weather be foul. on you will go though your enemies prowl. on you will go though the hakken-kraks howl. onward up many a frightening creek, though your arms may get sore and your sneakers may leak.  on and on you will hike, and i know you\\'ll hike far and face up to your problems whatever they are.  you\\'ll get mixed up, of course, as you already know. you\\'ll get mixed up  with many strange birds as you go. so be sure when you step. step with care and great tact and remember that life\\'s  a great balancing act. just never foget to be dexterous and deft. and never mix up your right foot with your left.  and will you succeed? yes! you will, indeed!  and  percent guaranteed.  kid, you\\'ll move mountains!  so... be your name buxbaum or bixby or bray or mordecai ali van allen o\\'shea, you\\'re off the great places! today is your day! your mountain is waiting. so...get on your way!now, the star-belly sneetches-  had bellies with stars.  the plain-belly sneetches-had none upon thars.    those stars weren\\'t so big. they were really so small.  you might think such a thing wouldn\\'t matter at all.   but, because they had stars, all the star-belly sneetches  would brag, \"we\\'re the best kind of sneetch on the beaches.  with their snoots in the air, they would sniff and they\\'d snort  \"we\\'ll have nothing to do with the plain-belly sort!\"  and whenever they met some, when they were out walking,  they\\'d hike right on past them without even talking.    when the star-belly children went out to play ball,  could a plain- belly get in the game...? not at all.  you only could play if your bellies had stars  and the plain-belly children had none upon thars.   when the star-belly sneetches had frankfurter roasts  or picnics or parties or marshmallow toasts,  they never invited the plain-belly sneetches.  they left them out cold, in the dark of the beaches.  they kept them away. never let them come near.  and that\\'s how they treated them year after year.   then one day, seems...while the plain-belly sneetches  were moping and doping alone on the beaches,  just sitting there wishing their bellies had stars...  a stranger zipped up in the strangest of cars!      \"my friends,\" he announced in a voice clear and keen,  \"my name is sylvester mcmonkey mcbean.  and i\\'ve heard of your troubles. i\\'ve heard you\\'re unhappy.  but i can fix that. i\\'m the fix-it-up chappie.  i\\'ve come here to help you. i have what you need.  and my prices are low. and i work at great speed.  and my work is one hundred per cent guaranteed!      then, quickly sylvester mcmonkey mcbean  put together a very peculiar machine.  and he said, \"you want stars like a star-belly sneetch...?  my friends, you can have them for three dollars each!\"   \"just pay me your money and hop right aboard!\"  so they clambered inside. then the big machine roared  and it klonked. and it bonked. and it jerked. and it berked  and it bopped them about. but the thing really worked!  when the plain-belly sneetches popped out, they had stars!  they actually did. they had stars upon thars!   then they yelled at the ones who had stars at the start,  \"we\\'re exactly like you! you can\\'t tell us apart.  we\\'re all just the same, now, you snooty old smarties!  and now we can go to your frankfurter parties.\"   \"good grief!\" groaned the ones who had stars at the first.  \"we\\'re still the best sneetches and they are the worst.  but, now, how in the world will we know,\" they all frowned,  \"if which kind is what, or the other way round?\"   then came  mcbean with a very sly wink.  and he said, \"things are not quite as bad as you think.  so you don\\'t know who\\'s who. that is perfectly true.  but come with me, friends. do you know what i\\'ll do?  i\\'ll make you, again, the best sneetches on beaches  and all it will cost you is ten dollars eaches.\"   \"belly stars are no longer in style,\" said mcbean.  \"what you need is a trip through my star-off machine.  this wondrous contraption will take off your stars  so you won\\'t look like sneetches who have them on thars.\"  and that handy machine working very precisely  removed all the stars from their tummies quite nicely.   then, with snoots in the air, they paraded about  and they opened their beaks and they let out a shout,  \"we know who is who! now there isn\\'t a doubt.  the best kind of sneetches are sneetches without!\"   then, of course, those with stars all got frightfully mad.  to be wearing a star now was frightfully bad.  then, of course, old sylvester mcmonkey mcbean  invited them into his star-off machine.   then, of course from then on, as you probably guess,  things really got into a horrible mess.  all the rest of that day, on those wild screaming beaches,  the fix-it-up chappie kept fixing up sneetches.  off again! on again!  in again! out again!  through the machines they raced round and about again,  changing their stars every minute or two.  they kept paying money. they kept running through  until neither the plain nor the star-bellies knew  whether this one was that one...or that one was this one  or which one was what one ...or what one was who.   then, when every last cent  of their money was spent,  the fix-it-up chappie packed up  and he went.   and he laughed as he drove  in his car up the beach,  \"they never will learn.  no. you can\\'t teach a sneetch!\"   but mcbean was quite wrong. i\\'m quite happy to say  that the sneetches got really quite smart on that day,  the day they decided that sneetches are sneetches  and no kind of sneetch is the best on the beaches  that day, all the sneetches forgot about stars  and whether they had one, or not, upon thars.at the far end of town where the grickle-grass grows and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it blows and no birds ever sing excepting old crows... is the street of the lifted lorax. and deep in the grickle-grass, some people say, if you look deep enough you can still see, today, where the lorax once stood just as long as it could before somebody lifted the lorax away. what was the lorax? and why was it there? and why was it lifted and taken somewhere from the far end of town where the grickle-grass grows? the old once-ler still lives here. ask him. he knows. you won\\'t see the once-ler. don\\'t knock at his door. he stays in his lerkim on top of his store. he lurks in his lerkim, cold under the roof, where he makes his own clothes out of miff-muffered moof. and on special dank midnights in august, he peeks out of the shutters and sometimes he speaks and tells how the lorax was lifted away. he\\'ll tell you, perhaps... if you\\'re willing to pay.  on the end of a rope he lets down a tin pail and you have to toss in fifteen cents and a nail and the shell of a great-great-great- grandfather snail. then he pulls up the pail, makes a most careful count to see if you\\'ve paid him the proper amount. then he hides what you paid him away in his snuvv, his secret strange hole in his gruvvulous glove. then he grunts, \"i will call you by whisper-ma-phone, for the secrets i tell you are for your ears alone.\"  slupp! down slupps the whisper-ma-phone to your ear and the old once-ler\\'s whispers are not very clear, since they have to come down through a snergelly hose, and he sounds as if he had smallish bees up his nose. \"now i\\'ll tell you,\"he says, with his teeth sounding gray, \"how the lorax got lifted and taken away...  external image slorax.jpg external image slorax.jpg   it all started way back... such a long, long time back... way back in the days when the grass was still green and the pond was still wet and the clouds were still clean, and the song of the swomee-swans rang out in space... one morning, i came to this glorious place. and i first saw the trees! the truffula trees! the bright-colored tufts of the truffula trees! mile after mile in the fresh morning breeze. and, under the trees, i saw brown bar-ba-loots frisking about in their bar-ba-loot suits as they played in the shade and ate truffula fruits. from the rippulous pond came the comfortable sound of the humming-fish humming while splashing around.  external image slorax.jpg external image slorax.jpg   but those trees! those trees! those truffula trees! all my life i\\'d been searching for trees such as these. the touch of their tufts was much softer than silk. and they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk. i felt a great leaping of joy in my heart. i knew just what i\\'d do! i unloaded my cart. in no time at all, i had built a small shop. then i chopped down a truffula tree with one chop. and with great skillful skill and with great speedy speed, i took the soft tuft, and i knitted a thneed! the instant i\\'d finished, i heard a ga-zump! i looked. i saw something pop out of the stump of the tree i\\'d chopped down. it was sort of a man. describe him?... that\\'s hard. i don\\'t know if i can.  external image slorax.jpg external image slorax.jpg   he was shortish. and oldish. and brownish. and mossy. and he spoke with a voice that was sharpish and bossy. \"mister!\" he said with a sawdusty sneeze, \"i am the lorax. i speak for the trees. i speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues. and i\\'m asking you, sir, at the top if my lungs\"- he was very upset as he shouted and puffed- \"what\\'s that thing you\\'ve made out of my truffula tuft?\" \"look, lorax,\" i said.\"there\\'s no cause for alarm. i chopped just one tree. i am doing no harm. i\\'m being quite useful. this thing is a thneed. a thneed\\'s a fine-something-that-all-people-need! it\\'s a shirt. it\\'s a sock. it\\'s a glove, it\\'s a hat. but it has other uses. yes, far beyond that. you can use it for carpets. for pillows! for sheets! or curtains! or covers for bicycle seats!\" the lorax said, \"sir! you are crazy with greed. there is no one on earth who would buy that fool thneed!\"  external image slorax.jpg external image slorax.jpg   but the very next minute i proved he was wrong. for, just at that minute, a chap came along, and he thought the thneed i had knitted was great. he happily bought it for three ninety-eight i laughed at the lorax, \"you poor stupid guy! you never can tell what some people will buy.\" \"i repeat,\" cried the lorax, \"i speak for the trees!\" \"i\\'m busy,\" i told him. \"shut up, if you please.\" i rushed \\'cross the room, and in no time at all, built a radio-phone. i put in a quick call. i called all my brothers and uncles and aunts and i said, \"listen here! here\\'s a wonderful chance for the whole once-ler family to get mighty rich! get over here fast! take the road to north nitch. turn left at weehawken. sharp right at south stitch.\" and, in no time at all, in the factory i built, the whole once-ler family was working full tilt. we were all knitting thneeds just as busy as bees, to the sound of the chopping of truffula trees.   then... oh! baby! oh! how my business did grow! now, chopping one tree at a time was too slow. so i quickly invented my super-axe-hacker which whacked off four truffula trees at one smacker. we were making thneeds four times as fast as before! and that lorax?... he didn\\'t show up any more. but the next week he knocked on my new office door. he snapped, \"i am the lorax who speaks for the trees which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please. but i\\'m also in charge of the brown bar-ba-loots who played in the shade in their bar-ba-loot suits and happily lived, eating truffula fruits. \"now... thanks to your hacking my trees to the ground, there\\'s not enought truffula fruit to go \\'round. and my poor bar-ba-loots are all getting the crummies because they have gas, and no food, in their tummies! \"they loved living here. but i can\\'t let them stay. they\\'ll have to find food. and i hope that they may. good luck, boys,\" he cried. and he sent them away. i, the old once-ler, felt sad as i watched them all go. but... business is business! and business must grow regardless of crummies in tummies, you know.  external image slorax.jpg external image slorax.jpg   i meant no harm. i most truly did not. but i had to grow bigger.so bigger i got. i biggered my factory. i biggered my roads. i biggered my wagons. i biggered the loads of the thneeds i shipped out. i was shipping them forth to the south! to the east! to the west! to the north! i went right on biggering... selling more thneeds. and i biggered my money, which everyone needs. then again he came back! i was fixing some pipes when that old-nuisance lorax came back with more gripes. \"i am the lorax,\" he coughed and he whiffed. he sneezed and he snuffled. he snarggled. he sniffed. \"once-ler!\" he cried with a cruffulous croak. \"once-ler! you\\'re making such smogulous smoke! my poor swomee-swans... why, they can\\'t sing a note! no one can sing who has smog in his throat. \"and so,\" said the lorax, \"-please pardon my cough- they cannot live here. so i\\'m sending them off. \"where will they go?... i don\\'t hopefully know. they may have to fly for a month... or a year... to escape from the smog you\\'ve smogged up around here.   \"what\\'s more,\" snapped the lorax. his dander was up. \"let me say a few words about gluppity-glupp. your machine chugs on, day and night without stop making gluppity-glupp. also schloppity-schlopp. and what do you do with this leftover goo?... i\\'ll show you. you dirty old once-ler man, you! \"you\\'re glumping the pond where the humming-fish hummed! no more can they hum, for their gills are all gummed. so i\\'m sending them off. oh, their future is dreary. they\\'ll walk on their fins and get woefully weary in search of some water that isn\\'t so smeary.\" and then i got mad. i got terribly mad. i yelled at the lorax, \"now listen here, dad! all you do is yap-yap and say, \\'bad! bad! bad! bad!\\' well, i have my rights, sir, and i\\'m telling you i intend to go on doing just what i do! and, for your information, you lorax, i\\'m figgering on biggering and biggering andbiggering and biggering, turning more truffula trees into thneeds which everyone, everyone, everyone needs!\" and at that very moment, we heard a loud whack! from outside in the fields came a sickening smack of an axe on a tree. then we heard the tree fall. the very last truffula tree of them all!    no more trees. no more thneeds. no more work to be done. so, in no time, my uncles and aunts, every one, all waved me good-bye. they jumped into my cars and drove away under the smoke-smuggered stars. now all that was left \\'neath the bad smelling-sky was my big empty factory... the lorax... and i. the lorax said nothing. just gave me a glance... just gave me a very sad, sad backward glance... as he lifted himself by the seat of his pants. and i\\'ll never forget the grim look on his face when he heisted himself and took leave of this place, through a hole in the smog, without leaving a trace. and all that the lorax left here in this mess was a small pile of rocks, with one word... \"unless.\" whatever that meant, well, i just couldn\\'t guess.  that was long, long ago. but each day since that day i\\'ve sat here and worried and worried away. through the years, while my buildings have fallen apart, i\\'ve worried about it with all of my heart. \"but now,\" says the once-ler, \"now that you\\'re here, the word of the lorax seems perfectly clear. unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. it\\'s not. \"so... catch!\" calls the once-ler. he lets something fall. \"it\\'s a truffula seed. it\\'s the last one of all! you\\'re in charge of the last of the truffula seeds. and truffula trees are what everyone needs. plant a new truffula.treat it with care. give it clean water. and feed it fresh air. grow a forest. protect it from axes that hack. then the lorax and all of his friends may come back.\"the time has come.  the time has come. the time is now.  just go. go. go!

 i can read with my left eye. i can read with my right. i can read mississippi with my eyes shut tight!  mississippi, indianapolis, and hallelujah, too! i can read them with my eyes shut! that is very hard to do!  but it\\'s bad for my hat and makes my eyebrows get red hot. so... reading with my eyes shut i don\\'t do an awful lot.  and when i keep them open i can read with much more speed. you have to be a speedy reader \\'cause there\\'s so, so much to read!  you can read about trees... and bees... and knees. and knees on trees! and bees on threes!  you can read about anchors. and all about ants. you can read about ankles! and crocodile pants!  you can read about hoses... and how to smell roses... and what you should do about owls on noses!  young cat! if you keep your eyes open enough, oh, the stuff you will learn! the most wonderful stuff! you\\'ll learn about... fishbones... and wishbones. you\\'ll learn about trombones, too. you\\'ll learn about jake the pillow snake and all about foo-foo the snoo.  you can learn about ice. you can learn about mice. mice on ice. and ice on mice. you can learn about the price of ice. nice ice for sale. ten cents a pail.  you can learn about sad... and glad... and mad! there are  so many things you can learn about. but... you\\'ll miss the best things if you keep your eyes shut.  the more that you read, the more things you will know. the more that you learn, the more places you\\'ll go.  you might learn a way to earn a few dollars. or how to make doughnuts... or kangaroo collars.  you can learn to read music and play a hut-zut if you keep your eyes open. but not with them shut.  if you read with your eyes shut you\\'re likely to find that the place where you\\'re going is far, far behind  so... that\\'s why i tell you to keep your eyes wide. keep them wide open... at least on one side.did you ever have the feeling there\\'s a wasket in your basket? or a nureau in your bureau? or a woset in your closet? sometimes i feel quite certain there\\'s a jertain in the curtain. sometimes i have the feeling there\\'s a zlock behind the clock. and that zelf up on that shelf!

the only one i\\'m really scared of is that vug under the rug. and that quimney up the chimney... i don\\'t like him. not at all. and it makes me sort of nervous when the zall scoots down the hall. but the yeps on the steps  they\\'re great fun to have around. and so are the many, many friends that i have found. like the tellar and the nellar and the gellar and the dellar and the bellar and the wellar and the zellar in the cellar.   and the geeling on the ceiling...  ...and the zower in my shower...  and the zillow on my pillow. i don\\'t care if you believe it. that\\'s the kind of house i live in. and i hope we never leave it.up pup pup is up. cup pup pup in cup. pup cup cup on pup. mouse house mouse on house. house mouse house on mouse. all tall we all are tall. all small we all are small. all ball we all play ball. ball wall up on a wall. all fall fall off the wall. day play we play all day. night fight we fight all night.he me he is after me. him jim jim is after him. see bee we see a bee. see bee three now we see three. three tree three fish in a tree. fish in a tree? how can that be? red red they call me red. red bed i am in bed. red ned ted and ed in bed pat pat they call him pat. pat sat pat sat on hat. pat cat pat sat on cat. pat bat pat sat on bat. no pat no don\\'t sit on that. sad dad bad had dad is sad. very, very sad. he had a bad day. what a day dad had!

the grinch hated christmas! the whole christmas season! now, please don\\'t ask why. no one quite knows the reason. it could be his head wasn\\'t screwed on just right. it could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight. but i think that the most likely reason of all, may have been that his heart was two sizes too small. whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes, he stood there on christmas eve, hating the whos, staring down from his cave with a sour, grinchy frown, at the warm lighted windows below in their town. for he knew every who down in whoville beneath, was busy now, hanging a mistletoe wreath. \"and they\\'re hanging their stockings!\" he snarled with a sneer, \"tomorrow is christmas! it\\'s practically here!\" then he growled, with his grinch fingers nervously drumming, \"i must find some way to stop christmas from coming!\" for tomorrow, he knew, all the who girls and boys, would wake bright and early. they\\'d rush for their toys! and then! oh, the noise! oh, the noise! noise! noise! noise! that\\'s one thing he hated! the noise! noise! noise! noise! then the whos, young and old, would sit down to a feast. and they\\'d feast! and they\\'d feast! and they\\'d feast! feast! feast! feast! they would feast on who-pudding, and rare who-roast beast. which was something the grinch couldn\\'t stand in the least! and then they\\'d do something he liked least of all! every who down in whoville, the tall and the small, would stand close together, with christmas bells ringing. they\\'d stand hand-in-hand. and the whos would start singing! they\\'d sing! and they\\'d sing! and they\\'d sing! sing! sing! sing! and the more the grinch thought of this who christmassing, the more the grinch thought, \"i must stop this whole thing!\" \"why, for fifty-three years i\\'ve put up with it now!\" \"i must stop this christmas from coming! but how?\" then he got an idea! an awful idea! the grinch got a wonderful, awful idea! \"i know just what to do!\" the grinch laughed in his throat. and he made a quick santy claus hat and a coat. and he chuckled, and clucked, \"what a great grinchy trick!\" \"with this coat and this hat, i look just like saint nick!\" \"all i need is a reindeer...\" the grinch looked around. but, since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be found. did that stop the old grinch? no! the grinch simply said, \"if i can\\'t find a reindeer, i\\'ll make one instead!\" so he called his dog, max. then he took some red thread, and he tied a big horn on the top of his head. then he loaded some bags and some old empty sacks, on a ramshackle sleigh and he hitched up old max. then the grinch said, \"giddap!\" and the sleigh started down, toward the homes where the whos lay asnooze in their town. all their windows were dark. quiet snow filled the air. all the whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care. when he came to the first little house on the square. \"this is stop number one,\" the old grinchy claus hissed, and he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist. then he slid down the chimney. a rather tight pinch. but, if santa could do it, then so could the grinch. he got stuck only once, for a moment or two. then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue. where the little who stockings all hung in a row. \"these stockings,\" he grinned, \"are the first things to go!\" then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant, around the whole room, and he took every present! pop guns! and bicycles! roller skates! drums! checkerboards! tricycles! popcorn! and plums! and he stuffed them in bags. then the grinch, very nimbly, stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney! then he slunk to the icebox. he took the whos\\' feast! he took the who-pudding! he took the roast beast! he cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash. why, that grinch even took their last can of who-hash! then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee. \"and now!\" grinned the grinch, \"i will stuff up the tree!\" and the grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove, when he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove. he turned around fast, and he saw a small who! little cindy-lou who, who was not more than two. the grinch had been caught by this tiny who daughter, who\\'d got out of bed for a cup of cold water. she stared at the grinch and said, \"santy claus, why, \"why are you taking our christmas tree? why?\" but, you know, that old grinch was so smart and so slick, he thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick! \"why, my sweet little tot,\" the fake santy claus lied, \"there\\'s a light on this tree that won\\'t light on one side.\" \"so i\\'m taking it home to my workshop, my dear.\" \"i\\'ll fix it up there. then i\\'ll bring it back here.\" and his fib fooled the child. then he patted her head, and he got her a drink and he sent her to bed. and when cindylou who went to bed with her cup, he went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up! then the last thing he took was the log for their fire! then he went up the chimney, himself, the old liar. on their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire. and the one speck of food that he left in the house, was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse. then he did the same thing to the other whos\\' houses leaving crumbs much too small for the other whos\\' mouses! it was quarter past dawn... all the whos, still a-bed, all the whos, still asnooze when he packed up his sled, packed it up with their presents! the ribbons! the wrappings! the tags! and the tinsel! the trimmings! the trappings! three thousand feet up! up the side of mt. crumpit, he rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it! \"poohpooh to the whos!\" he was grinchishly humming. \"they\\'re finding out now that no christmas is coming!\" \"they\\'re just waking up! i know just what they\\'ll do!\" \"their mouths will hang open a minute or two, then the whos down in whoville will all cry boohoo!\" \"that\\'s a noise,\" grinned the grinch, \"that i simply must hear!\" so he paused. and the grinch put his hand to his ear. and he did hear a sound rising over the snow. it started in low. then it started to grow. but the sound wasn\\'t sad! why, this sound sounded merry! it couldn\\'t be so! but it was merry! very! he stared down at whoville! the grinch popped his eyes! then he shook! what he saw was a shocking surprise! every who down in whoville, the tall and the small, was singing! without any presents at all! he hadn\\'t stopped christmas from coming! it came! somehow or other, it came just the same! and the grinch, with his grinch-feet ice-cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling \"how could it be so?\" \"it came with out ribbons! it came without tags!\" \"it came without packages, boxes or bags!\" and he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore. then the grinch thought of something he hadn\\'t before! \"maybe christmas,\" he thought, \"doesn\\'t come from a store.\" \"maybe christmas...perhaps...means a little bit more!\" and what happened then? well...in whoville they say, that the grinch\\'s small heart grew three sizes that day! and the minute his heart didn\\'t feel quite so tight, he whizzed with his load through the bright morning light, and he brought back the toys! and the food for the feast! and he, he himself! the grinch carved the roast beast!one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish, black fish, blue fish, old fish, new fish. this one has a littlecar. this one has a little star. say!
