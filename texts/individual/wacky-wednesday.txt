It all began
With that shoe on the wall.
A shoe on a wall...?
Shouldn't be there at all!

Then I looked up.
And I sad "Oh, MAN!"
And that's how Wacky Wednesday Began.

I looked out the window.
And I said, "GEE!"
More things were wacky!
And I saw three.

I went down the hall
And I said "HEY!"
Three more things were wacky today!

In the bathroom, MORE!
In the bathroom, FOUR!

I began to dress.
Then I said, "WOW!"
Four MORE things were wacky now!

I looked in the kitchen.
I said "By cracky!
Five more things 
Are very wacky!"

I was late for school.
I started along.
And I saw that 
Six more things were wrong.

And then seven more!

And the Sutherland sisters!
They looked wacky, too.
They said "Nothing is wacky around here but you!"

"But look!" I yelled.
"Eight things are wrong here at school."
"Nothing is wrong." They said
"Don't be a fool."

I ran into school
I yelled to Miss Bass...
... "Look! Nine things are wacky
Right here in your class!"

"Nothing is wacky here in my class!
Get out! You're the wacky one! OUT!"
Said Miss Bass.

I went out the school door.
Things were worse than before.
I couldn't believe it.
Ten wacky things more!

Then I counted ELEVEN!
Then... twelve WORSE things!
I got scared and I ran.
I ran and knocked over Patrolman McGann.

"I'm sorry, Patrolman." 
That's all I could say.
"Don't be sorry," he smiled.
"It's that kind of a day.
But be glad! Wacky Wednesday will soon go away!"

"Only twenty things more will be wacky," he said.
"Just find them and then you can go back to bed."

Wacky Wednesday was gone when I counted them all.
And I even got rid of that shoe on the wall.
