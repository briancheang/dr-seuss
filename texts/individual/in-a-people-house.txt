"Come inside, Mr. Bird,"
Said the mouse.
"I'll show you what there is
In the People House...

A People House has things like...
...chairs
Things like roller skates
And stairs

Banana bathtub bottles brooms
That's what you find in people's rooms
Scissors needle buttons thread
Cup and saucer pillow bed

These are doughnuts.
Here's a door
Come along, I'll show you more.
Here's a ceiling here's a floor.

Piano peanuts popcorn pails
Pencil paper hammer nails
Salt and pepper goldfish key
Table telephone TV
Come on! Come on! There's more to see!

You'll see a kitchen sink 
In a People House.
A shoe and a sock and a clock said the mouse

Bread and butter window wall
Toothbrush hairbrush big blue ball
Baked beans bureau drawers and books
Lights and lamps and hats and hooks

Mirror marbles shirt and string
Knife fork spoon and bells to ring
Doll and dishes teapot trash
Look out below! I'm going to crash

And... Another thing it's time you knew...
... A People House has people, too!

"And now, Mr. Bird, you know."
Said the mouse.
"You know what there is in a People House."
