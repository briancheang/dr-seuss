One apple up on top!

Two apples up on top!

Look, you.
I can do it, too.

Look!
See!
I can do three!

You can do three,
But I can do more.
You have three, but I have four.

Look! 
See, now.
I can hop with four apples up on top.

And I can hop up on a tree with four apples up on me.

Look here, you two.
See here, you two.
I can get five on top.
Can you?

I am so good I will not stop.
Five!
Now six!
Now seven on top!

Seven apples up on top!
I am so good they will not drop.

Five, six, seven!
Fun, fun, fun!
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!

But, see!
We are as good as you.
Look! Now we have seven, too.

And now see here.
Eight! Eight on top!
Eight apples up!
Not one will drop.

But I can do nine. 
And hop!
And drink!
You can not do this, I think.
